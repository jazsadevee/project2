You might need to do this in two batches if you don't have a large skillet. Make sure your oil is hot to get a nice golden-brown coating instead of simply steaming the chicken. Make the Bourbon Sauce! Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté for about 30 seconds. Then add the rest of the ingredients and whisk in the cornstarch to make sure no clumps remain. Bring the mixture to a light boil, carefully add the chicken back in, and let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes until it reduces in half."

Then add the onions and peppers, and cook for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent. Add the black beans, yellow corn, salt, cumin, oregano, and smoked paprika. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, until the mixture has fully heated through. Add 1/4 cup enchilada sauce, stir to combine, and remove from heat. Taste and season with more salt if necessary. Microwave the tortillas on a plate for 1 minute, flipping them halfway through until all of them are warm and pliable. Pour 1/4 cup of the enchilada sauce into a 9×13 baking dish, and spread it out to coat the bottom of the dish. Assemble the enchiladas by filling each tortilla evenly with the black bean mixture and 3/4 cup of shredded cheese. Roll the tortillas tightly to close and place in prepared baking dish seam side down. Pour the remaining 1 1/2 cups enchilada sauce over the tortillas, top with the remaining 1 1/4 cups shredded cheese, and bake for 20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve immediately and garnish."
